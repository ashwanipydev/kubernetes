- 🔧 **Hands-on exercises** to reinforce learning
- 🏗️ **Mini-projects** to build your portfolio
- ✅ **Validation steps** to verify your understanding

By the end of this 45-day journey, you'll have the skills and confidence to:
- Deploy and manage production-grade Kubernetes clusters
- Debug and troubleshoot complex container orchestration issues
- Implement security best practices
- Set up monitoring and logging solutions
- Write infrastructure as code using Helm charts
